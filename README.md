# AK-Bank-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp-Global-AI-Hub



**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a predictive model that classifies whether an individual is at risk of a heart attack based on various health and lifestyle attributes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to assist in early detection and preventive care strategies.


**Goal**

The primary goal is to predict the likelihood of a heart attack (Outcome) using patient features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, lifestyle factors (smoking, diabetes, etc.), and medical history.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes 32 features ranging from demographic data and vital signs to personal and medical history

**Algorithms Used**

Logistic Regression – Interpretable baseline for binary classification.

Random Forest – Ensemble learning method that handles feature interactions and outliers well.

XGBoost – Advanced boosting technique optimized for speed and performance.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Effective in high-dimensional spaces.

Each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.



**Use Case**

This model could be integrated into a clinical decision-support tool to assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk patients during routine checkups or remote monitoring systems.



**Future Improvements**

Feature Engineering: Incorporate interaction terms, domain-specific insights, or external health data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search or Bayesian optimization for better performance.

Model Ensemble: Combine models for improved robustness.

Explainability: Add SHAP or LIME to make predictions more interpretable for clinicians.

Deployment: Develop a simple web app or API for real-world usage.
